A denial of service is an attack aimed at slowing down or completely rendering a website inaccessible to legitimate users by overloading the server.

### I've created this script to show how easy it is and how few lines of code are required. This means that, in the absence of protection, this type of attack is very easy to carry out even with little technical knowledge. So it's imperative to protect yourself and adopt best practices to reduce your vulnerability.

## How it work's?
After retrieving the target IP address, and finding the open ports, we use "socket" to establish the connection.
The data we send is randomly generated using the os.urandom(50000) function, which means we generate 50,000 bytes of random data on each iteration of the loop.
In short, this script continuously sends random data to the IP address on the specified port via a TCP or UDP connection.

## How to protect?
To protect against a "DDoS" (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, where a large number of malicious requests are sent to overwhelm a server, here are some steps you can take:
- Use a robust firewall: Configure a firewall to filter and block malicious traffic. A firewall can detect and block suspicious source IP addresses sending anomalous traffic.
-  Implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): An IDS/IPS can help detect and block suspicious activity, including DDoS attacks, by monitoring network traffic and taking proactive measures to mitigate them.
-     Use DDoS mitigation services: Some providers offer DDoS mitigation services that can filter and block malicious traffic before it reaches your server. These services often use techniques such as real-time traffic analysis, rule-based filtering and load balancing to mitigate DDoS attacks.
-  Set bandwidth limits: Limit the bandwidth available for each IP address to prevent a single IP address from monopolizing all your server's bandwidth.
- Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network): A CDN can distribute traffic over several geographically dispersed servers, which can help spread the load and mitigate DDoS attacks.
-     Implement captcha or human verification systems: Add human verification mechanisms to filter out automated bots, such as captchas or verifications based on human behavior. 
- Monitor and analyze traffic: Keep a close eye on incoming traffic to detect abnormal patterns or traffic spikes that could indicate a DDoS attack in progress. Analyze logs to identify attackers' source IP addresses and block them if necessary.
- Set up incident response plans: Have incident response plans in place to react quickly in the event of a DDoS attack. This can include procedures for blocking source IP addresses, reducing the load on the server and informing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block malicious traffic at a higher level.
